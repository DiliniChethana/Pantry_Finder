# Pantry_Finder

This repository contains the Pantry Finder project. The frontend was bootstrapped with Create React App and the backend uses Flask.

## Frontend (Create React App)

In the `frontend/` directory you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it.

### `npm run build`

Builds the production bundle to the `build/` folder.

See the Create React App documentation for more details.

## Backend (Flask)

In the `backend/` directory run the Python app (use your virtualenv):

```powershell
C:/path/to/venv/Scripts/python.exe -u main.py
```

There is a convenience endpoint `GET /db/init` that will create the database tables during development.
